# gake

`gake` stands for "Ghetto Make" and it's a shell script. You can use it to
automate your builds. If it doesn't exactly fit your needs you can open it up
and modify it, it's small and fairly understandable.

You give it a list of .c files, it builds .o files and links them. If that's
not enough for your project and you feel you'd better use tools like autoconf
or cmake, then it's best for you to use those tools.
